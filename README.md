# Stopwatch

This Android app features a simple timer with start, stop, and reset functionalities. The main screen displays a large text view showing elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Users can initiate the timer using the "Start" button, pause it with the "Stop" button, and reset the timer using the "Reset" button. The app employs a handler to update the time display every second while the timer is active.
